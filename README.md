# SearchableTest

This project shows how to use a SearchView in the Toolbar (as an action view) to search for content in the DB and displaying the result in the same activity as the search happens, instead of launching a search result activity.

Libs used in the project:
  - [ActiveAndroid](https://github.com/pardom/ActiveAndroid)
  - Android support libs (appcompat, design, cardview-v7, recyclerview-v7)
  - [CursorRecyclerViewAdapter](https://gist.github.com/skyfishjy/443b7448f59be978bc59)
